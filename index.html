              Hello! I am Alayna Hart. I am a student at Brigham Young
              Univerity-Idaho majoring in Web Design and Development and
              minoring in Computer Programming. I love programming, designing,
              and developing. My hope for my personal website is that you will
              see my passion for web design as well as the things I have learned
              in my courses so far. Take a look around and message me with any
              questions or comments. I look forward to meeting you!

                <h1>Logo Project</h1>
                <h2>
                  For this project, I created a unique logo for a fictional
                  baseball cap company featuring a turtle mascot. The project
                  guidelines required the use of a maximum of three colors and
                  the incorporation of shapes, rather than strokes.

                <h1>Album Project</h1>
                <h2>
                  This album cover was created for Haupe by Duke Ellington
                  (1959) as part of an assignment to design a cover for an
                  instrumental song produced before the 1960s. The project
                  specifications allowed for only five colors and required the
                  use of basic shapes (triangle, circle, rectangle, and line),
                  along with the song title, artist's name, and year of release.

                <h1>Portfolio Practice Website</h1>
                <h2>
                  In my first web development class, I built a practice
                  portfolio website to showcase my academic journey. The site
                  featured three distinct pages: the first describing html and
                  css principles, one highlighting the courses I had completed,
                  and another showcasing my projects. Throughout the process, I
                  applied fundamental web design principles that I had learned.

                <h1>My Favorite Movies Website</h1>
                <h2>
                  In my second web development class, I designed a two-page
                  website featuring my favorite movies and a movie trivia game.
                  The first page includes a list of my favorite films, each
                  accompanied by a title, description, and image. The page also
                  allows users to search and sort the movies dynamically. The
                  second page offers a trivia game where users can test their
                  knowledge by answering questions related to the featured
                  films.
